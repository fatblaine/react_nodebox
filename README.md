# react_nodebox

Providing two versions for this small react project.

## Code Comparison Explanation
Both code snippets are designed to create a FlashCards application using React components, but they differ in how they manage state and structure their components. Let's detail the differences between the two:

### Code One:
- The `FlashCards` component renders a list of cards, each represented by a `Card` component.
- Each `Card` component manages its own state `sid`, which tracks whether it is selected (flipped).
- When a card is clicked, only that card flips. If the same card is clicked again, it flips back to its original state.

### Code Two:
- The `FlashCards` component itself manages a state `selectedId`, which tracks the currently selected card ID.
- All cards share the same state, and when any card is clicked, `selectedId` updates.
- If a flipped card is clicked, it flips back to its original state. If another card is clicked, the previously flipped card flips back, and the newly clicked card flips.

### Final Effect Differences:
- In **Code One**, each card's flip state is independent, allowing multiple cards to be flipped at the same time.
- In **Code Two**, only one card can be flipped at a time. Clicking a new card will cause the previously flipped card to flip back.
